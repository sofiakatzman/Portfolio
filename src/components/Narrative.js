        Born in Uruguay and arriving in the United States at the age of 7, I was
        raised in a family deeply involved in construction and homemaking. When
        I think of Uruguay, I remember peeling green beans with my grandpa,
        camping with family, eating delicious asado con chimichurri, and chasing
        chickens in the backyard. With a Spanish-to-English dictionary in one
        pocket and my plastic cellphone in the other, I was ready to conquer
        life in America.

        Skipping formal education, I dove straight into the workforce. My career
        began in June 2013 with an internship at Blue Apple Books, where I
        processed mail, organized bookshelves, and took lunch orders. This
        experience laid the groundwork for my work ethic and professional
        development. By July 2014, I was promoted to Operations Assistant and
        Graphic Design Personal Assistant at Blue Apple Books, where I assisted
        creative and operations directors in fulfilling daily tasks, cleaned up
        photos, processed art, and put together catalogues.

        In September 2015, I made a career switch to become a CoD Account
        Manager and Customs Broker at AllWays Forwarding. Here, I processed
        customs entries, calculated duty tariffs, filed paperwork with
        government agencies, and managed global deliveries. My in-depth
        understanding and patience earned me the 'Cash on Delivery' accounts,
        allowing me to guide new importers through the previously unknown
        process.

        By March 2016, I advanced to a role as Freight Forwarding Manager and
        Customs Broker at AllWays Forwarding, where I helped create an
        experimental division handling both freight forwarding and customs
        brokerage. In June 2017, I transitioned to the operator side as a
        Logistics Manager at Haelssen & Lyon, a prestigious German tea supplier,
        pricing out the freight cost of tea orders and tasting some of the most
        incredible teas.

        In January 2018, I dipped my toes into operations as an Operations
        Manager at AB Global, handling logistics and operations for iconic brand
        projects like the installation of Gucci's Miami facade and planning the
        deliveries for the Hudson Yards Vessel. By May 2018, I joined Intel's
        Mobileye as an Operations Manager, managing the US HQ office in NY,
        processing sales orders, tracking inventory for financial closings, and
        preparing quarterly closing statements.

        As of 2021, I ended up joining one of my freelance clients full-time as
        Director of Operations and Design at Provocateur NY, a luxury
        hospitality company. We planned some of the most amazing shows - from
        having The Martinez Brothers play at the Hudson Yard's Edge to creating
        full popup restaurant experiences that required full branding and
        interior decorating and art installation fabrication, my passion was in
        everything I did. tears went into everything we did. We built pop-up
        experiences that truly left marks on everyone who was there. I am so
        proud of some of the work we accomplished.

        Driven by my passion for art and design, I made a decisive career shift,
        becoming a certified full stack software engineer in June 2023 after
        completing a Full Stack Bootcamp at Flatiron School. This transition was
        fueled by my insatiable curiosity and a desire to blend my artistic
        creativity with technical proficiency. Today, I thrive because of the
        skills I learned by being software engineer and designer, bringing a
        unique perspective shaped by my diverse background.
      </p>

        Currently, I serve as a production designer at Scholastic, where I
        leverage my multifaceted skill set to develop marketing emails, design
        web assets, and automate workflows using advanced design tools.
        Concurrently, I contribute to DevOps and AI content marketing at TyMoo,
        applying my operations and development expertise.

        I excel in dynamic environments and embrace challenges eagerly. I
        prioritize building meaningful relationships—with clients, colleagues,
        and collaborators—believing they are crucial for success and personal
        growth. Outside of work, I enjoy swimming, experimenting with baking,
        and immersing myself in gaming.
